In this assignment I went thorugh all of the functions and added all of the operators to complete the function. Some of the operators were common sense or just took a minute to look up the symbol used to complete the operation while others were made up of many more parts which constituted an more in depth understanding. All of the operations referenced a11, a2, a3, l list, and s string at the bottom of the code. Hopefully there are more excercises that make use of these operations so I will be ablle to remember them.
